short-description: News group classification inference pipeline deployed using AWS Sagemaker
description: Train a machine learning model with a newsgroup dataset which should be able to categorize a news summary from 20 different news categories. Create an inference pipeline in AWS Sagemaker and deploy it on sklearn docker container.
solution: Td-idf is chosen as the word to vector model, MultiNomial Naive Bayes algorithm is used the learning algorithm to learn the category of the document content passed as input to the model. Inference pipeline is setup in AWS sage maker studio, 2 endpoints created (1 for inferencing, and another for training the model on demand). 
results: F1-Score of ~81% achieved on testing dataset, which is equivalent to ~ 240 times a document category is correctly predicted out of 300 documents (Test data).
