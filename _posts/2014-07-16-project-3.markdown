short-description: Aspect based sentiment analysis model which has the capability to effictively predict the sentiment of a review comment from pre defined categories - positive, negative and neutral
description: Build an aspect based sentiment analysis model which will be able to predict the sentiment of a review comment from pre defined categories positive, negative and neutral.
solution: LSTM neural network is trained with the input word vectors and target(aspect) text. The word embedding is created from the pretrained GloVe Twitter Dataset with 25/125/200 dimension size. 
results: The training, testing accuracy comparison with a regular LSTM and Aspect based LSTM suggest that the Aspect based LSTM outperforms a regular LSTM and hend concludes the fact that on providing target text to the input the model performs better.
