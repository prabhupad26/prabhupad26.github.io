description: Generate a transcription of a voice recording which is stored in a sound file
solution: A pretrained model - wav2vec 2.0 is loaded which was trained on 50 hours of unlabeled speech recordings from different authors along with different background noises, in this project I have explored two approaches, one involve finetuning of pretrained model and another without any finetuning.
results: Word Error rate is used as the metric to measure the performance of the model on testing dataset, which is found to be as low as 8.3 %
