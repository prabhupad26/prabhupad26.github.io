certification_1: Advanced certiﬁcation in AI & ML , IIIT Hyderabad
description_1: As part of this certification I have developed multiple machine learning projects in computer vision, speech recognition, Alexa chatbot development, and many more projects which helped me in understanding the complete lifecycle of a machine learning solution.
certification_2: AIML Certiﬁcation by DRDO (Defence & Research Organization)
description_2: This certification has helped me in getting exposure to the real world application of computer vision in a defence domain.
certification_3: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng , Coursera
description_3: With this certification I got to know about the mathematical aspects of a ML model , able to develop loss functions, train complex linear regression objective functions using Octave programming language
certification_4: AI Programming in Python , Udacity Nanodegree
description_4: This was a introductory certification I did at the very begining, this helped me in getting an understanding about the basic machine learning concepts , able to fine tune a pretrained model to recognise the type of flower from an input image.
